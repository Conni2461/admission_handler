Meeting 20.1.2022
Other Groups:
-> Do we need to store a history of messages on the servers?
-> During presentation, use multiple webex accounts (for example dummies) to share different screens
-> and/or show setup using a phone or similar
Our Group:
Deal with locking and ordering separately?
	-> Current solution needs to be reevaluated to see if it really works in all problem cases
	-> Prof. had the impression that this are two orthogonal problems and we may want to look into them separately
Server crashes during voting -> simply skipped might not be so simple
	-> maybe just restart the election in this case (unless that is already how it is implemented)
