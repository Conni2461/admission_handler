Servergroup with leader -> we have to implement voting etc.
Every server has groupview
Leader has final say on groupview
Leader pings servers, broadcasts new groupview in case of failure

Clients attach to first server that responds to them?
or
Client always broadcasts request (-> any server can crash and we don't care)

Client - Server "3 or more-way Handshake" for incrementing visitor counter
-> includes who got in, to later get order and if request was successful
-> includes current free spots in server response (to get an idea of how many spots are left)
-> server that handles request has to check with other servers if request is actually successful (-> reliable ordered multicast thingy)

2 laptops -> one for servers, one for clients
Servers maintain db with order?
	-> SQLite memory db pro server?
	-> simply in memory?
