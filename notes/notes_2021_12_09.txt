- Internet Problems
tcp/udp are separate from our send, order etc. guarantees

Edge Case: Two Servers become leaders because they do not hear from each other fast enough > did we think about this scenario (as in, even with waiting through the timeouts)?

Heartbeats -> Fault Detection
Then? -> Fault Tolerance
	-> How many heartbeats can be missed/what's the timeout exactly?

Generally: Be more deterministic/precise/algorithmic (not "when it misses TOO MANY heartbeats")

Security is no concern of us
Failure Handling is limited to Omission, Crashes, Byzantine

SQL is fine, distributed database system is not

number of arrivals is synchronized between servers?
 -> wrong place in the text maybe?

total ordering makes more sense than causal?
  -> need to check our understanding of what means what exactly
  
block or roll back conflicts when accessing the same resource

replication -> writing might be a problem (at least efficiency-wise), instead of for reading, optimize architecture for writing
