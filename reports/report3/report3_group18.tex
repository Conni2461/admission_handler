\section{Introduction}
This project implements a distributed admission system for large events and venues with limited capacity.
The stream of visitors entering or exiting the venue will be monitored in real-time via devices at each entrance.
Live feedback will be provided to each device, enabling organizers to stop admission when the maximum capacity of the venue has been reached.

As the world starts to reopen after the pandemic and public events become possible again, systems are required to handle the keeping of safe capacities, in-line with changing guidelines and laws.
Pre-selling tickets is one possibility of managing these limits, yet events such as Christmas markets, beer gardens and public concerts live off spontaneous visits.
This project will enable the simple monitoring and managing of such streams of visitors, by providing a dynamically scalable system.

\section{Requirements Analysis}

\input{mrequirement_analysis}

\section{Architecture}
The system will be modeled in a single network with at least a machine running multiple clients and at least two running some servers each.
Both participant types will be written in Python.\\
